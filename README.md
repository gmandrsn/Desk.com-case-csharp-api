# Desk.com-case-csharp-api
A C# Desk.com API client for inserting/migrating cases from any source system into Desk.com 

This is code that may be helpful if you are migrating from a C# codebase, internal support system to Desk.com.  It uses RestSharp to make calls into the desk.com v2 API.  I used it to populate about 700K cases from our home grown support system as we migrated to desk.com
